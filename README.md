# Geto's Dirt Locker 2: Electric Boogaloo - Browser Version
This is a joke program used to archive 'dirt' on people specifically crafted for [adocord](https://discord.gg/ado1024) in Discord. This project has been submitted as my final project for my programming class in 2024.
This specific version of the program serves only for users to browse through the dirt entries and not for any addition/deletion.

# Installation
Please note that this program has only been tested on **Windows** and might not work on other systems.<br>

1. Download the [installer present on the releases page](https://github.com/MrKelpy/GetosDirtLockerBrowser/releases/latest) or clone this repository using.:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MrKelpy/GetosDirtLockerBrowser
```

2. Run the program once in order to create the database configuration file and setup the `%appdata%/.GetosLocker/data/database.cfg` file if needed according to the information below. If your database is local, you can skip this.

### - REMOTE DATABASE CONNECTION
In order to setup the database on a remote server, you must run the program once and navigate to `%appdata%/.GetosLocker/data`. In there, you'll find a `database.cfg` file that configures the host of the database in the following format: `IPADDRESS:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD`

You may have to use a VPN like [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/) in order to connect remotely to a database.
